We are excited to announce the establishment of our group, which is funded by the Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF, Federal Ministry of Education and Research) through the project OIDLITDSM in the field of AI. It is located at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), Heidelberg University. We are also affiliated with the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Heidelberg University and are members of the cluster of excellence STRUCTURES.
